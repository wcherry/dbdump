# dbdump

## A simple database dump tool written in Rust to be super fast.

## Installation

Currently builds are produced OSX only for both the Intel and Apple chip-set.

- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/wcherry/dbdump/releases)
- Unzip the downloaded zip file - it will create a directory for each supported operating system
- Select the correct operating system and platform (e.g. macos/intel)
- Copy the executable from the correct folder and copy to where you want to execute it from (e.g. `~/bin`)
- Run the executable supplying no-arguments - It will typically fail the first time you run it due to security constraints
  - Grant access to dbdump in your security settings
  - Run a second time - it will display the usage instructions

The are no other required resources to run.

Check the [build](#building-from-source) section for instructions on building the executable for other platforms.

## Uninstall

Delete the executable.
